# StudyingNx (real case)

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev) and was used to define (or not) Nx as a solution in a real case.

## The case

In our case, the system has been working a take of while already and has these main characteristics:
- Monolith created by [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/cli-service.html)
- [Vue (JS Framework)](https://cli.vuejs.org)
- The frontend team (and the company itself) has been growing significantly
- The frontend team (and the company itself) has been growing significantly
- The frontend team has a good communication and they wanna keep it as possible
- The company is focused on quality, even if sometimes they reduce speed (development-wise, relaease-wise)

## Proposal (Nx)

### Before get started

Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that there are different approaches to solving that problem, and unfortunately and likely, all of them will have their problems. So, let's *bloom* our analytic part and keep our eyes on the prize: solve our problem. This way, even if we get a un perfection solution, we'll get one of the best ones!
